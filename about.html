                    <p>II’m Lena, a graphic and communication designer born and raised in the south of Germany. I studied in Munich for three years and one year in London, where I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in June 2021.

                        Graphic Design is a powerful tool. I aspire to spread a message that helps, motivates, and inspires people and challenges them to think outside the norm. My work aims to activate people’s imagination and stimulate their emotions through a strong visual aesthetic.
                        
                        I enjoy the process of a project, diving into the subject, having fun in the making, and finding innovative solutions that are rare & inspiring to the public eye.
                        
                        I’m passionate about graphics, typography, illustration, and animation design. But above all, I love experimenting, inventing, and challenging myself to find new ways to design.
                        
                        My workflow is embedded in a curious and positive attitude with a focus on attentiveness to detail. Please feel free to get in touch if you’re interested in working with me.</p>
